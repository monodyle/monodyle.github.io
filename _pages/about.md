Hello, I’m **Lê Hồng Minh**, a nickname is **Monody Le**, just a guy tends to be handsome gradually over the years..

I was born a child of the mountains and forests, raised on the land of sunny which named Central Highlands. Should be I hadto growvegetables andchickens, but now I go coding.

Now I'm studying at **Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh - University of Information Technology**, main major is **Information Systems**.

Would like to become a Front-end Engineering, and maybe a Full-stack Web Engineering.
